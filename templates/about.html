<h2>About Page</h2>
<p>
    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
    came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
    decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
    also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
    superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
    business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            Thorin Oakenshield
        </h3>
        <p>
            Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
            youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770.
            While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in
            the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of
            Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the ground
            as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.
            <br>
            Thorin became King-in-Exile of Durin's Folk in TA 2850 after his father went missing, and died in the
            dungeons of Dol Guldur.

            Fíli and Kíli
        </h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also nephews
            of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.
            <br>
            As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent scouting or searching. It
            was they that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Mountains.
            <br>
            With the other Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking
            Thranduil. They escaped the cells thanks to Bilbo, traveling down the river in barrels until they reached
            Lake-town. The brothers accompanied Thorin and Bilbo to Lake-town while the others rested by the
            river.
            <br>
            At the feet of the Lonely Mountain, Fíli and Kíli scouted Ravenhill and found the Front Gate with Balin and
            Bilbo. Also, with Bilbo, they found the side-door leading into the mountain.
            <br>
            Both brothers were killed while defending the mortally wounded Thorin Oakenshield in the Battle of Five
            Armies, and all three were buried with honor.

        <h3>
            Óin
        </h3>
        <p>
            Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin,
            the father of Balin and Dwalin.
            <br>
            Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's
            company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood. Óin was one of the Dwarves who
            bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were
            usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the group. He
            fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II
            Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the company of Thorin.

            Glóin
        </h3>
        <p>
            Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and
            younger brother of Óin.
            <br>
            In TA 2941, Glóin and his brother Óin, along with his cousins Dwalin and Balin, were among the Dwarves
            accompanying Thorin and Company during their quest to the Lonely Mountain to recapture it from the dragon
            Smaug. He was noted for his skills with a tinderbox, and, along with his brother Óin, was usually the one
            told to get a fire started whenever the Dwarves made camp. Glóin also fought in the Battle of Five
            Armies. After the battle, he made his home in the Lonely Mountain.

        <h3>
            Balin
        </h3>
        <p>
            Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother
            named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain.
            <br>
            Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs
            which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied
            Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was
            captured and lost.

            Dwalin
        </h3>
        <p>
            Dwalin was the first Dwarf to arrive, alone, at Bag End when the unexpected party planned by Thorin and
            Gandalf began at Bilbo Baggins' hobbit hole. Wearing a dark-green hood and a golden belt, he walked into
            Bilbo's home as if expected, which greatly surprised Bilbo. Soon Balin arrived, and he and Dwalin sat
            talking while Bilbo kept answering the door for the arrival of more and more Dwarves. Later, when Bilbo
            griped aloud in his kitchen about the lack of help in setting out refreshments, Dwalin and Balin were the
            first (followed by Fíli and Kíli) to lend a hand. Later still, when the Dwarves filled Bag End with music,
            Dwalin played on a viol as big as himself.[1] Dwalin lent a green hood and cloak to Bilbo when they set out
            on their journey.
            <br>
            After Thorin's Company reclaimed the mountain from Smaug, Dwalin fought alongside his companions in the
            Battle of Five Armies. He survived the battle, and later received his fourteenth share of Smaug's hoard. He
            chose to live afterwards in Erebor under the rule of Dáin II Ironfoot, Thorin's cousin and now King under
            the Mountain.

            Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years, alongside his cousins: Dori and
            Nori. In the year TA 2941, Ori became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo
            Baggins, and the other Dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug.
            <br>
            Finally, he and the other Dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five Armies in TA 2942, which
            he survived.

            It fell to Dori to carry Bilbo Baggins in the tunnels of the Misty Mountains during the escape from the
            Goblins, but Dori dropped Bilbo, and the other Dwarves and Gandalf blamed him for "losing their burglar."
            Later, during their escape from the Wargs and Orcs, Dori helped Bilbo climb a tree to get away from the
            wargs. Bilbo shortly thereafter saved Dori by grabbing his legs as they were rescued by the Great Eagles and
            taken to their eyrie from the Misty Mountains. When Gandalf tells their tale to the skin-changer Beorn and
            brings forward the company, Dori came first, along with Thorin.

        <p>
            Nori, as was his brother Dori, was a capable flutist, and both seem to have carried their flutes with them.
            Both shared Bilbo's liking for regular meals. Before the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Nori lived in
            Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains with his two brothers.
            <br>
            In TA 2941, Nori, along with Dori and Ori, became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and
            traveling with him in search of Smaug's treasure in the Lonely Mountain. After their experience in
            Goblin-town when the company was pursued by Wargs and Orcs and forced to climb up into some trees, Nori was
            the first realize that Bilbo had been left on the ground and pointed him out to his brother Dori who rescued
            Bilbo.

            killed by Goblins, Wargs, Stone giants, Great Spiders, and the dragon Smaug himself. A valiant and brave
            warrior, Bifur never gave up, and fought in the Battle of Five Armies with all his strength, killing
            numerous enemies.
            <br>
            In the fallout of the great battle, Dáin II Ironfoot gave him his share of the treasure,

            Bombur
        </h3>
        <p>
            Bombur's parentage is unknown. He was the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's
            line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm. His birth date is unknown, though it fell
            somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen "by some
            fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and
            Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey,
            Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.
            <br>
            He fought and survived along with most of the company at the Battle of Five Armies. After the defeat of
            Smaug, Bombur received his share of the treasure and remained at the Lonely Mountain until the end of his
            days.

            Bilbo Baggins

        <p>
            Bilbo Baggins was a Hobbit of the Shire, the main protagonist of The Hobbit and a secondary character in The
            Lord of the Rings.
            <br>
            Gandalf suggested to Thorin and Company that they hire Bilbo Baggins to be their burglar in the Quest of
            Erebor, and later fought in the Battle of Five Armies. Bilbo was also one of the bearers of the One Ring,
            and the first to voluntarily give it up, although with some difficulty. He wrote many of his adventures in a
            book he called There and Back Again. Bilbo adopted his second-cousin-once-removed Frodo Baggins to be his
            heir after his parents, Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck, drowned in the Brandywine River.
            <br>
            Bilbo was the first hobbit to become famous in the world at large, and one of the few to set foot in the
